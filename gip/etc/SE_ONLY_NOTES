To run the GIP in standalone SE mode the following step must be taken:

Extra Requirement:  a valid osg-user-vo-map.txt is needed.

Assumption:  The GIP will be run on a machine with the same type of access to
    an SE that a CE normally would have.

1) copy gip.se_only.example.conf to $GIP_LOCATION/etc/gip.conf
2) fill in the locations of the osg_config file and the osg-user-vo-map.txt
    * It is recommended that they be placed in $GIP_LOCATION/etc as well
      This makes the GIP completely self contained and portable.
3) Fill out a config.ini for the SE only site.  The known minimum sections are:
    DEFAULT, Site Information, Storage, GIP, and SE <name>

   a) see the OSG twiki for specific help on each of the sections
   b) the Storage section only needs:
        se_available = %(enable)s
        default_se = <se fqdn>
   c) the GIP section only needs:
        advertise_gsiftp = %(disable)s
4) Place the config.ini in the location specified in step 2.
5) copy a valid osg-user-vo-map.txt file to the location specified in step 2.
6) copy $GIP_LOCATION/bin/run_gip.sh.se_only.example to
   $GIP_LOCATION/bin/run_gip.sh
7) modify the VDT_LOCATION and GIP_LOCATION paths in run_gip.sh to the location
   that you placed the gip.  GIP_LOCATION should point directly to the gip
   directory.  VDT_LOCATION should point to the parent directory.
