A subcluster represents a homogeneous collection of nodes within a cluster.

Information about this storage area (SA).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The storage area information is used to determine which directories a VO can
use on your storage element.  Each storage area has a "root path" which is the
root of the storage area and a "vo path" which a specific VO can write into
relative to the root.

For example, if the root path is "/mnt/grid_storage" and the VO path for CMS
is "cms", CMS will write into "/mnt/grid_storage/cms".

To configure this, we will first set up a root path and default all VOs 
"vo path" to be $VO_NAME, and you may set up individual exceptions.
