Changelog
== 1.1.10alpha0 ==

  section of the config.ini) 
* Revised option names (excluded_groups -> exclude_groups, 
  exclude_schedd -> exclude_schedds)

  commands work are found in the environment and work.
* New other_ces parameter to publish other CEs in the cluster (for the CE to
  SE bindings)
* Enforce condor invariants -- we should do a better job reporting the number
  of free and running slots 

== 1.1.3 ==
* If storage_vos is set, ignore the blacklist/whitelist for storage (storage_vos is an explicit whitelist already).

* Insert newlines before stanzas if needed

	max_total <= max_running 
	free_slots <= max_running 
	assigned <= max_running
	
== 1.1.2 ==
* Include both old (voname) and new (VO:voname) ABCRs in GlueSA ACBRs 
* Now correctly identify the default SE to eliminate false "UNKNOWN" values for the Classic SE
* Fixed setting clusters and cesebind in config_ini and blank acbrs in the SA
* Fix to allow multiple SE's for a single CE
* Added new unittests for CESEBind and Cluster overides
* Unittests now will run without any outside configuration dependencies

== 1.1.1 ==
* allow old-style storage config again (GIP stanza)
* BeStMan: correctly determine SE space when no space tokens exist
* BeStMan: improved logging
* Parse updated srm-ping output
* Fix crashing LSF provider

== 1.1.0rc1 ==
* More fleshed out (but probably still broken) SGE provider 
* Fix to include default SE and publish correctly
* Revert to config.ini instead of current-config.ini
	
== 1.1.0 ==
* Removal of gip-attributes.conf and configure_gip perl script, because: 
* We now read config.ini directly
* Reconfigured GIP providers to determine the correct batch system and storage
  system on-the-fly, removing the need for admin configuration
* We do not attempt to auto-detect subclusters
* New wrapper script with new name (osg_info_wrapper.py): (CEMon 
  compatibility issue)
* Wrapper script supports a new delete-attributes.conf
* Completely new providers for Condor, LSF, and SGE.  SGE and LSF are lightly
  tested (SGE probably does not yet work out of the box).
* Condor provider now advertises data consistently with the other batch 
  system providers.
* New BestMan provider
* New dCache provider
* New provider for dCache 1.9 which does NOT need the dCache admin interface
* Improved adherence to Glue 1.3 
* Increased unit test coverage
* Glue parameters CESEbind, site, subclusters, and cluster entries are all 
  dynamic
* Improved and more secure method for advertising VO-installed software
* Glue 1.3 style AccessBaseControlRules are used (CEMon compatibility issue)
* Storage and subcluster configurations via config.ini have been refactored 
  to be simpler and more straightforward.

  GlueSAAccessLatency, GlueSAExpirationMode,GlueSACapability, 
  GlueSEImplementationName,GlueSEStatus (9,12)

== 1.0.1 ==

Bugs fixed (references to GIP ticket numbers in [])
  - The dynamic providers were parsing the VO list differently than in
    previous cases [1]
  - For an SRM SE, GlueSEArchitecture is changed from "disk" to "other".
    This avoids the classicSE script trying to execute df in the wrong
    places [2, 8]
  - $GIP_LOCATION/etc/gip.conf was not being read in some cases due to
    invalid path expansion [3]
  - Multiple collector hosts were not getting parsed correctly (GIP
    ticket [4]
  - OSG Version is now published along with the software tags [5]
  - PBS dynamic provider was not parsing waiting jobs correctly (GIP
    ticket [6]
  - For non-PBS sites using dynamic dcache, GlueSEUniqueID was not being
    correctly generated [7]
  - GlueCESEBindCEAccessPoint will not double-count the GlueSAPath now
  - Wrong permissions and ownership were generated for
    dcache_storage.conf, gip.conf
  - CESEBind now advertises /UNAVAILABLE instead of dropping the
    attribute if the access point is not set
  - SRM hostname was being advertised based on reverse DNS, which is a
    problem for sites where the SRM host is a CNAME instead of an A
    name.  We now print out the admin-specified hostname if the IP
    matches.

== 1.0.0_rc1 ==

* Fixes: Unique name for SE Control protocol; VO view of SA now
  matches SA unique ID.
* Bugfix: Don't assume OSG_GIP_SIMPLIFIED_PATH exists
